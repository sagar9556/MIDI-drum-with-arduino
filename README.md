MIDI-drum-with-arduino
======================

This Project aims to design an electronic drum using pressure sensor with Arduino. The beat can be recognized by pressure on particular pressure sensor i.e. piezo-electric transducer. The sound is generated by most popular sound engineering software, Ableton Live. The project also involves serial to MIDI notes conversion and MIDI mapping for each Pad.
